= Towards instantaneous performance analysis using coarse-grain sampled and instrumented data =

== Folding mechanism ==

* Instrumentation delimits repetitive regions
* Sampling => progression
* Create a syntetic instance with combination of sampled data


=== Perf ctr ===

Three summary plots:

* Instruction Miss
    * Type of instructions / time
* Arch impact
    * Type of miss (cache level, msis predict)
* Stall distrib
    * causes of stall

=== Memory ===

* No thread infos
