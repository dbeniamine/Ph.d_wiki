== Memoire ==

=== GPU ===

* Tal Ben-Nun Memory access paterns (GPU)
    * Automatic memory pattern optim
    * Specify access as a pattern and generate automatized code
    * http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/project/maps/

=== CPU ===

* Liu: Identify Memory scalability bottlenecks (paper, Williamsburg)
* Husain: Relating Memory Perf to data application domain (workshop VPA, LLNL
/ MemAxes)
* Lot of people interested on memory analysis (discussion off)

== VPA ==

Trend: mapping performances on data domain:

* Hussain: Memory + domain
* 2 papers for scheduling: mapping performances on DAG
* Von RÃ¼den: Cube + Find interesting part of visu
    * Reduce research space
    * Remove low information visu
    * Recognize identical views
        * Use known patterns

= Reproductible =

== BOF ==

Helmar Burkart (Univ of Basel) Gerhard Wellein (Univ of Erlangen-Nuremberg)

* Room was full
* Several definition of reproducibility
* Importance of reproducibility / ability to compare and discuss a paper results
* Several people presented weird behavior that they saw to explain how hard
reproducibility is

== Invited talk ==

Victoria stodden
Overview of tools methods and why do reproducible

* Look Kepler, Chameleon

= Women in HPC =

* BOF + Workshop (sadly same time as VPA)
* Very interesting discussion on
    * How to make job proposition more inclusive
    * Know our biais before going to a jury
    * Impostor syndrome
* Statistics from Argonne
    * Lot of diversity in post doc / doctorants
    * Permanent are all white males
    * What about us ?!
* Women in HPC are on FB, linkedin everywhere take one minute
