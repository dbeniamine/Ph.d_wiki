The field users (for both structure and access) is a bitmask corresponding to
a list of threads for example 1010 means that the threads 2 and 4 are
implicated in the access.
The type of an access is R, W or RW. Value is the
percentage of reads.

== Example ==

| `Struct A 0x4000 512 0b1`          | A structure named A at 0x4000 of size    |
| \/                                 |  512 used by the thread 0 (2^0==1)       |
| `Acess 42 48 0x4010 16 R 100 0b1`  | A read acess at 0x4010 of size 16 from   |
| \/                                 | time 42 to 48 by the thread 0 (2^0==1)   |
| `Struct Unnamed 0x5000 1024 0b101` | An anonymous structure at 0x5000 of size |
| \/                                 | 1024 used by threads 2 (2^2==100) and 0  |
| `Acess 49 55 0x50ff 4 RW 75 0b101` | An RW access (75% read) at 0x50ff of     |
| \/                                 | size 4 from time 49 to 55 by threads 0   |
| \/                                 |  and 2                                   |


== Notes ==

We need to compute all zones of a structure (simple division, ZoneSize can be
0 !!).
A structure or a Zone is identified by its adress.
If a structure is not named, its name will be "Unnamed".
An access is identified by its timestamp. The start adress of an acces is the
identifier of the parent zone.
Lines can be in any order.
ZoneSize is always before a list of Struct, it can appaers several times.
Zones can be printed serveral times. Access can't.
The type of an access is R, W or RW. if the access type is RW value is the
percentage of reads, in all other case value is meaningless.
