==  Introduction to visualization, *Hamish Carr* ==

==  Intro ==

* Visualization fondation McCormack, DeFanti & Brown, 1987
* Three situations:
* Explain: known question, known answer
* Determine: Knwown question, unknown answer
    * Explore: unknown question
* Edmond Halley (1656-1742)
    * Bivariate plots
    * Vector visualization
    * Contour plots
* Graphical Integrity
    * Lie Factor $Lie Factor=\frac{Size of effect shown}{Size of data}$
* Scientific Visualization see scheme on notebook
* Classification
    * Continuous model => Scientific Visualization
    * Discrete model => Information visualization

===  Scatter visu ===

* $F: \mathbb{R}^{d(+1)} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
* 2D Data
    * Glyph rendering (huge matrix  A(i,j)=F(x,y))
    * Hard to understand
* Intensity Mapping
    * Apply mapping to the Glyph
    * The more intense the higher value
    * Use color, conventions exists (land altitude example blue water, green
     land)
* Surface rendering
    * Draw the function as a manifold
* Contour Facturemaps
    * *Warning:* people are used to use them for topography in other context
     this kind of plots can be misleading
    * Meaning:
        * Boundaries
        * Between isovalues
        * Information on gradient
* Isosurface
    * Static cutaway (allow to see what is inside)
* Direct volume rendering => color and opacity mapping on data (3D version
 of color mapping)
    * First intersection: Isosurface
    * Average Intensity
        * constant opacity Facture through volume
        * equivalent to an x-ray
    * Higher Intensity ...
* Multi-D transfert fct
    * Plot multi D data to see what to emphasize
* Continous scatterplots

===  Vector visualization ===

* $F: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$
* Domain is spatial
* Range consits of vectors
* time variying $F: \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$
* Steadness: if flow vary with time
* Streamlines
    * A thread haging in a steady flow
    * Parametrised curve follows the vectors
    * Good for smooth flow
* Path lines
    * Particules injected into the flow
    * parametrised by time $t$
    * gives a sens of the flow evolution
* Spot Noise
    * Motion blurred particles
    * ellipses oriented to flow
    * *Problems*
        * Ambiguity
        * Perspective shortenning
        * **Remedy: 3D-Arrows**
            * *Problem* : very costly
        *3D streamlines
            * Where start the lines
            * Very context dependant
        * streambals / streamtubes
* **Tensors**
    * Glyphs
    * Tensor streamlines

==  Visualization with VTK, *Hank Childs* ==

* VTK (Fundamental concepts)
    * Library for visualization
    * written C++ / binding in TCL, Java, Python
    * Object oriented
    * Designed for extensibility
    * Data flow network model(+underneath // runtime )
        * Reusability
        * *Not efficient:*
            * Lot of intermediate mem copy
            * **Cache !!**
* VTK
    * 4 main types derived from VTKDataSets
        * VTKStructuredGrid

            Cells can be anything, no regular properties

        * VTKUnStructuredGrid

            Regularity between cells

        * VTKLinearGrid

            Simple rectangle matrix

        * VTKPolyData
    * Algorithm (VTKAlgorithm) == Filter
        * If 0 input => Source
        * If 0 output => Sink
    * Every object must be in the heap
        * Garbage collector
            * Register() after   New() (increment ref counts)
            * Delete()

            It is also possible to use vtkSmartPointer to avoid managing this
    * Graphisms

        *See scheme on notebook*

==  Parallel Visualization ==

See slides, to much drawing to explain

==  Visualization Applications, *Dave Pugmire* ==

    Visualization is a method of computing. It transforms the symbolic into the
    geometric [...]

==  Topological aspects,*Valerio Pascucci* ==

* Reeb graph and contour tree
    * Domain + functions => contracted into graph of changes
    * Chraracterizes fundamntal properties
    * Allow to view thinks hiden by 3D (internal component)
