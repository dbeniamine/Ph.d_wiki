= Reducing the amount of experiments =

* Select important factors
* Create expirement orthogonal table
    => Vectors of values for all the factors (othogonal base)

= Guidelines =

* Recognition of and statement of the problem
* Selection of the response variable
* Choice of factors = > Fishbones diagrams
* Choice of the experimental design, randomization, replication
* Performing the exp
* Statistical analysis of the data
* Conclusions and recommendations
