=  Jean Marc Vincent: From chaos to complexity =

Laplace determinisme :  
Avec un snapshot de l'univers et la connaissance de tous les couples
cause-effet, il serait possible de connaitre le futur.

==  Dynamical systems ==

* State space
    * Description
    * Structure
    * Semantic
* Time representation
    * Discrete
    * Continue
    * With / Without history


=== Questions ? ===

Infinite horizon

* Stability
* Existance of stat regime
* Speed of convergence
* Computability

==  Magician's hat ==

Todo 

==  Random Promenade ==

ergotic theorem : (on ergotic systems) you have the same information by 
measuring the trajectory of one particule during a long time than by looking
all the system.

"The unstability of a deterministic dynamic gives birth to a random phenomena"
Y.G Sinai

==  Computation with chaos ==

Buffon's Needle => computation of Pi
    * Not verify efficient (100 experiment => 2 digits)
    * First random algorithm
