* Framesoc fix Youenn:
    * Ok for export
    * Still slow / visu hard
* Lucas: lot of progress, time to look at actual traces, see [[vfile:../../labbook-lucas/LabBook.org|LabBook]]
* [o] Moca traces:
    * [X] New mat-modulo (fix missing part of the trace)
    * [.] MG:
        * [X] Class S and W, no issue, very quick
        * [ ] Class A, trying to find good parameters
            * Base: 293 sec
            * Reducing log interval helps down to 229s
            * Increasing chunks size also  down to 199s
            * Redo it more seriously
