== Framesoc / Ocelotl ==

=== Importer ===

* Hierarchy + data structures ok
* Keep only accesses on memory structs

=== Visu ===

Very slow / unable to re run / modify p value: there is probably a memory
leak, Youenn is (?) looking for it see:
https://github.com/soctrace-inria/framesoc/issues/189


== Paje ==

* Using dump via framesoc
* pje_gantt can display States:
    * No hierarchy informations
    * Why do we use variables in framesoc ?
    * BUG:
    {{{
