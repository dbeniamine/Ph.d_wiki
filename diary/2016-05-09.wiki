Working on fgemm (fflas-lapack) traces.

First traces had issues with the address pace:
    * [X] BUG Fixed: va_space_randomization was not removed anymore (since
          when ?)
    * [ ] Address inside a dynamic binary is only an offset, the true address
          of a structure should be offset+addr(binary)
        * Using ldd + Offet: 0 accesses within Givaro structures
        * Without offset: 0 accesses within Givaro structures
        * Only 163/232 (depending on the trace) accesses in the malloc'ed addresses ...
